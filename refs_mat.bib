abstract = {Current nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) deals with X = FGT type. We provide a systematic analysis and extensions of NMF to the symmetric W = HHT, and the weighted W = HSHT. We show that (1) W = HHT is equivalent to Kernel if-means clustering and the Laplacian-based spectral clustering. (2) X = FGT is equivalent to simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a bipartite graph. Algorithms are given for computing these symmetric NMFs.

abstract = {We present several new variations on the theme of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Considering factorizations of the form X=FG(T), we focus on algorithms in which G is restricted to containing nonnegative entries, but allowing the data matrix X to have mixed signs, thus extending the applicable range of NMF methods. We also consider algorithms in which the basis vectors of F are constrained to be convex combinations of the data points. This is used for a kernel extension of NMF. We provide algorithms for computing these new factorizations and we provide supporting theoretical analysis. We also analyze the relationships between our algorithms and clustering algorithms, and consider the implications for sparseness of solutions. Finally, we present experimental results that explore the properties of these new methods.},

abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a widely used tool for the analysis of high-dimensional data as it automatically extracts sparse and meaningful features from a set of nonnegative data vectors. We first illustrate this property of NMF on three applications, in image processing, text mining and hyperspectral imaging --this is the why. Then we address the problem of solving NMF, which is NP-hard in general. We review some standard NMF algorithms, and also present a recent subclass of NMF problems, referred to as near-separable NMF, that can be solved efficiently (that is, in polynomial time), even in the presence of noise --this is the how. Finally, we briefly describe some problems in mathematics and computer science closely related to NMF via the nonnegative rank.},

@article{Hong2016,
abstract = {The primary latent factor model cannot effectively optimize the user-item latent spaces because of the sparsity and imbalance of the rating data. Although existing studies have focused on exploring auxiliary information for users or items, few researchers have considered users and items jointly. For instance, social information is incorporated into models without considering the item side. In this paper, we introduce latent space regularization (LSR) and provide a general method to improve recommender systems (RSs) by incorporating LSR. We take the assumption that users prefer items that cover one or several topics that they are interested in, instead of all the topics, which reflects real-world situations. For instance, a user may focus on the humorous part of an item when he or she is at leisure time, regardless of the relevance of the item to his research topics. LSR operates from this assumption to account for both the user and item sides simultaneously. From another point of view, LSR is likely to improve the Tanimoto similarity of observed user-item pairs. As a result, LSR utilizes the number of ratings in a manner similar to weighted matrix factorization. We incorporate LSR into both the traditional collaborative filtering models that use only rating information and the collaborative filtering model that uses auxiliary content information as two examples. Experimental results from on two real-world datasets show not only the superiority of our model over other regularization models, but also its effectiveness and the possibility of incorporating it into various existing latent factor models.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses some algorithms for the use of non-negativity constraints in unmixing problems, including positive matrix factorization, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and their combination with other unmixing methods such as non-negative independent component analysis and sparse non-negative matrix factorization. The 2D models can be naturally extended to multiway array (tensor) decompositions, especially non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) and non-negative tucker decomposition (NTD). The standard NMF model has been extended in various ways, including semi-NMF, multilayer NMF, tri-NMF, orthogonal NMF, nonsmooth NMF, and convolutive NMF. When gradient descent is a simple procedure, convergence can be slow, and the convergence can be sensitive to the step size. This can be overcome by applying multiplicative update rules, which have proved particularly popular in NMF. These multiplicative update rules have proved to be attractive since they are simple, do not need the selection of an update parameter, and their multiplicative nature, and non-negative terms on the RHS ensure that the elements cannot become negative.},

In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area.},

abstract = {Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a relatively novel paradigm for dimensionality reduction, has been in the ascendant since its inception. It incorporates the nonnegativity constraint and thus obtains the parts-based representation as well as enhancing the interpretability of the issue correspondingly. This survey paper mainly focuses on the theoretical research into NMF over the last 5 years, where the principles, basic models, properties, and algorithms of NMF along with its various modifications, extensions, and generalizations are summarized systematically. The existing NMF algorithms are divided into four categories: Basic NMF (BNMF), Constrained NMF (CNMF), Structured NMF (SNMF), and Generalized NMF (GNMF), upon which the design principles, characteristics, problems, relationships, and evolution of these algorithms are presented and analyzed comprehensively. Some related work not on NMF that NMF should learn from or has connections with is involved too. Moreover, some open issues remained to be solved are discussed. Several relevant application areas of NMF are also briefly described. This survey aims to construct an integrated, state-of-the-art framework for NMF concept, from which the follow-up research may benefit.},

We provide a brief overview over the task of recommender systems and traditional approaches that do not use social network information. We then present how social network information can be adopted by recommender systems as additional input for improved accuracy. We classify CF-based social recommender systems into two categories: matrix factorization based social recommendation approaches and neighborhood based social recommendation approaches. For each category, we survey and compare several representative algorithms.},
