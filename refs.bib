The result of applying our method is a simultaneous clustering of the rows, columns, and slices of a three-mode tensor, and the idea generalizes to any number of modes. The algorithm we design works by recursively bisecting the tensor into two pieces. We also design a new measure to understand the role of each cluster in the tensor. Our new algorithm and pipeline are demonstrated in both synthetic and real-world problems. On synthetic problems with a planted higher-order cluster structure, our method is the only one that can reliably identify the planted structure in all cases. On tensors based on n-gram text data, we identify stop-words and semantically independent sets; on tensors from an airline-airport multimodal network, we find worldwide and regional co-clusters of airlines and airports; and on tensors from an email network, we identify daily-spam and focused-topic sets.},

abstract = {Convolutional rectifier networks, i.e. convolutional neural networks with rectified linear activation and max or average pooling, are the cornerstone of modern deep learning. However, despite their wide use and success, our theoretical understanding of the expressive properties that drive these networks is partial at best. On other hand, we have a much firmer grasp of these issues in the world of arithmetic circuits. Specifically, it is known that convolutional arithmetic circuits posses the property of "complete depth efficiency", meaning that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in order to be implemented (or even approximated) by a shallow network. In this paper we describe a construction based on generalized tensor decompositions, that transforms convolutional arithmetic circuits into convolutional rectifier networks. We then use mathematical tools available from the world of arithmetic circuits to prove new results. First, we show that convolutional rectifier networks are universal with max pooling but not with average pooling. Second, and more importantly, we show that depth efficiency is weaker with convolutional rectifier networks than it is with convolutional arithmetic circuits. This leads us to believe that developing effective methods for training convolutional arithmetic circuits, thereby fulfilling their expressive potential, may give rise to a deep learning architecture that is provably superior to convolutional rectifier networks but has so far been overlooked by practitioners.},

A related problem from both the mathematical and algorithmic points of view is the distance geometry problem of realizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise distances.

In this paper we show that the Tucker core of a tensor however, retains many properties of the original tensor, including the CP rank, the border rank, the tensor Schatten quasi norms, and the Z-eigenvalues. Since the core is typically smaller than the original tensor, this property leads to considerable computational advantages, as confirmed by our numerical experiments.

Folded-concave penalization methods have demonstrated surprising developments in sparse learning problems due to their nice practical and theoretical properties. To share the same light of folded-concave penalization methods, we propose a new tensor completion model via folded-concave penalty for estimating missing values in tensor data. Two typical folded-concave penalties, the minmax concave plus (MCP) penalty and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, are employed in the new model. To solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we develop a local linear approximation augmented Lagrange multiplier (LLA-ALM) algorithm which combines a two-step LLA strategy to search a local optimum of the proposed model efficiently. Finally, we provide numerical experiments with phase transitions, synthetic data sets, real image and video data sets to exhibit the superiority of the proposed model over the nuclear norm penalization method in terms of the accuracy and robustness.},

abstract = {Higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is an efficient way for data reduction and also eliciting intrinsic structure of multi-dimensional array data. It has been used in many applications, and some of them involve incomplete data. To obtain HOSVD of the data with missing values, one can first impute the missing entries through a certain tensor completion method and then perform HOSVD to the reconstructed data. However, the two-step procedure can be inefficient and does not make reliable decomposition.   In this paper, we formulate an incomplete HOSVD problem and combine the two steps into solving a single optimization problem, which simultaneously achieves imputation of missing values and also tensor decomposition. We also present two algorithms for solving the problem based on block coordinate update. Global convergence of both algorithms is shown under mild assumptions. The convergence of the second algorithm implies that of the popular higher-order orthogonality iteration (HOOI) method, and thus we, for the first time, give global convergence of HOOI.   In addition, we compare the proposed methods to state-of-the-art ones for solving incomplete HOSVD and also low-rank tensor completion problems and demonstrate the superior performance of our methods over other compared ones. Furthermore, we apply them to face recognition and MRI image reconstruction to show their practical performance.},

Although an increasingly common task, tensor recovery remains a challenging problem because of the delicacy associated with the decomposition of higher order tensors. To overcome these difficulties, existing approaches often proceed by unfolding tensors into matrices and then apply techniques for matrix completion. We show here that such matricization fails to exploit the tensor structure and may lead to suboptimal procedure. More specifically, we investigate a convex optimization approach to tensor completion by directly minimizing a tensor nuclear norm and prove that this leads to an improved sample size requirement. To establish our results, we develop a series of algebraic and probabilistic techniques such as characterization of subdifferetial for tensor nuclear norm and concentration inequalities for tensor martingales, which may be of independent interests and could be useful in other tensor related problems.},

abstract = {We propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) based on spectral decomposition methods. While spectral methods have been previously employed for consistent learning of (passive) latent variable models such as hidden Markov models, POMDPs are more challenging since the learner interacts with the environment and possibly changes the future observations in the process. We devise a learning algorithm running through episodes, in each episode we employ spectral techniques to learn the POMDP parameters from a trajectory generated by a fixed policy. At the end of the episode, an optimization oracle returns the optimal memoryless planning policy which maximizes the expected reward based on the estimated POMDP model. We prove an order-optimal regret bound w.r.t. the optimal memoryless policy and efficient scaling with respect to the dimensionality of observation and action spaces.},

@article{Zhou2016,
abstract = {We consider the problem of uplink channel estimation for millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, where the base station (BS) and mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with large antenna arrays to provide sufficient beamforming gain for outdoor wireless communications. Hybrid analog and digital beamforming structures are employed by both the BS and the MS due to hardware constraints. We propose a layered pilot transmission scheme and a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition-based method for joint estimation of the channels from multiple users (i.e. MSs) to the BS. The proposed method exploits the sparse scattering nature of the mmWave channel and the intrinsic multi-dimensional structure of the multiway data collected from multiple modes. The uniqueness of the CP decomposition is studied and sufficient conditions for essential uniqueness are obtained. The conditions shed light on the design of the beamforming matrix, the combining matrix and the pilot sequences, and meanwhile provide general guidelines for choosing system parameters. Our analysis reveals that our proposed method can achieve a substantial training overhead reduction by employing the layered pilot transmission scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed method presents a clear advantage over a compressed sensing-based method in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational complexity.},

abstract = {In this study, we propose a new method for multifocus image fusion by combining with the structure tensors of mixed order differentials and the multiscale neighborhood. In this method, the structure tensor of an integral differential is utilized to detect the high frequency regions and the structure tensor of the fractional differential is used to detect the low frequency regions. To improve the performance of the fusion method, we propose a new focus measure based on the multiscale neighborhood technique to generate the initial fusion decision maps by exploiting the advantages of different scales. Next, based on the multiscale neighborhood technique, a post-processing method is used to update the initial fusion decision maps. During the fusion process, the pixels located in the focused inner regions are selected to produce the fused image. In order to avoid discontinuities in the transition zone between the focused and defocused regions, we propose a new “averaging” scheme based on the fusion decision maps at different scales. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed the conventional multifocus image fusion methods in terms of both their subjective and objective quality.},

abstract = {Graph partitioning plays a central role in machine learning, and the development of graph partitioning algorithms is still an active area of research. The immense demand for such algorithms arises due to the abundance of applications that involve pairwise interactions or similarities among entities. Recent studies in computer vision and databases systems have emphasized on the necessity of considering multi-way interactions, and has led to the study of a more general problem in the form of hypergraph partitioning.   This paper focuses on the problem of partitioning uniform hypergraphs, which arises in computer vision applications such as subspace clustering, motion segmentation etc. We show that uniform hypergraph partitioning is equivalent to a tensor trace maximization problem, and hence, a tensor based method is a natural answer to this problem. We also propose a tensor spectral method that extends the widely known spectral clustering algorithm to the case of uniform hypergraphs. While the theoretical guarantees of spectral clustering have been extensively studied, very little is known about the statistical properties of tensor based methods. To this end, we prove the consistency of the proposed algorithm under a planted partition model.   The computational complexity of tensorial approaches has resulted in the use of various tensor sampling strategies. We present the first theoretical study on the effect of sampling in tensor based hypergraph partitioning. Our result justifies the empirical success of iterative sampling techniques often used in practice. We also present an iteratively sampled variant of the proposed algorithm for the purpose of subspace clustering, and demonstrate the performance of this method on a benchmark problem.},

abstract = {Spectro-spatial dimensionality reduction in HyperSpectral Images (HSI) classification is a challenging task due to the problem of curse dimensionality, i.e. the high number of spectral bands and the heterogeneity of data. In this context, many dimensionality reduction methods have been developed to overcome the high correlation between bands and the redundancy of information in order to improve the classification accuracy. Most of these methods represent the original HSI as a set of vectors. Therefore, they only exploit spectral properties, neglecting the spatial information, i.e. the spatial rearrangement is lost. To jointly take advantage of spatial and spectral information, HSI has been recently represented as a tensor. In order to preserve the spatial and spectral information, we develop a hybrid method using both the Tensor Locality Preserving Projections method (TLPP) projecting the original data into a lower subspace and the Constrained Band Selection method (CBS) to select the relevant bands. These two methods will be jointly used to get high-level quality classification. Moreover, since the two obtained classifications are uncertain and imprecise, we propose to fuse them using the Dempster-Shafer’s Theory (DST) to obtain an accurate classification preserving the spectro-spatial information. The proposed approach has been applied on real HSI showing its efficiency compared with conventional dimensionality reduction methods.},

abstract = {The tensorial nature of crack density of an initially isotropic 2D medium with open and closed cracks is studied by means of polar decomposition rewriting of standard micro-mechanics results. The question of both indicial and constitutive symmetries of different crack density tensors is addressed: for instance the standard fourth order crack density tensor Dc is rari-constant (totally symmetric) and the fourth order closed cracks density tensor  by which closed cracks are acting is found to have the square symmetry. The effect of cracks closure and sliding is accordingly shown to be represented by a second order tensor ($\delta$c) so that only two second order crack density tensors, do and $\delta$c, are needed for 2D medium with open and closed sliding cracks. Similarly to the open cracks case, any arbitrary closed crack system is shown to be represented by only two non orthogonal families of cracks. The question of macroscopic cracks closure conditions is finally studied. Present study leads to an approximate framework in which the only internal variable representative of physical cracks, open and closed, is second order cracks density tensor. Proposed second order tensorial framework is shown to be exact in the case of two orthogonal arrays of cracks, open and/or closed, it is approximate in the general case of many arrays of cracks, open and/or closed.},

In this paper, we introduce and analyse a reduced basis approach to computation of the Bethe–Salpeter excitation energies which can lead to a relaxation of the numerical costs down to O(N3). The BSE operator is specified in terms of the two-electron integrals in the Hartree–Fock molecular orbital basis and the respective energies, calculated by the tensor-based solver described in previous works. The reduced basis method includes two steps.

abstract = {Nowadays, human movement in urban spaces can be traced digitally in many cases. It can be observed that movement patterns are not constant, but vary across time and space. In this work,we characterize such spatio-temporal patterns with an innovative combination of two separate approaches that have been utilized for studying human mobility in the past. First, by using non-negative tensor factorization (NTF), we are able to cluster human behavior based on spatio-temporal dimensions. Second, for understanding these clusters, we propose to use HypTrails, a Bayesian approach for expressing and comparing hypotheses about human trails. To formalize hypotheses we utilize data that is publicly available on the Web, namely Foursquare data and census data provided by an open data platform. By applying this combination of approaches to taxi data in Manhattan, we can discover and explain different patterns in human mobility that cannot be identified in a collective analysis. As one example, we can find a group of taxi rides that end at locations with a high number of party venues (according to Foursquare) on weekend nights. Overall, our work demonstrates that human mobility is not one-dimensional but rather contains different facets both in time and space which we explain by utilizing online data. The findings of this paper argue for a more fine-grained analysis of human mobility in order to make more informed decisions for e.g., enhancing urban structures, tailored traffic control and location-based recommender systems.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
We provide a survey of recent advances in biomedical image analysis and classification from emergent imaging modalities such as terahertz (THz) pulse imaging (TPI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRIs) and identification of their underlining commonalities. 

METHODS
Both time and frequency domain signal pre-processing techniques are considered: noise removal, spectral analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and wavelet transforms. Feature extraction and classification methods based on feature vectors using the above processing techniques are also discussed. These include Mahalanobis distance, support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) classifiers. 

VALIDATION
Examples where the proposed methodologies have been successful in classifying TPIs and DCE-MRIs are discussed. 

RESULTS
Identifying commonalities in the structure of such heterogeneous datasets potentially leads to a unified multi-channel signal processing framework for biomedical image analysis. 

CONCLUSION
The proposed complex valued classification methodology enables fusion of entire datasets from a sequence of spatial images taken at different time stamps; this is of interest from the viewpoint of inferring disease proliferation. The approach is also of interest for other emergent multi-channel biomedical imaging modalities and of relevance across the biomedical signal processing community.},

One important problem in nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) in the context of user-guided audio source separation is the necessity to manually assign the NTF components to audio sources in order to be able to enforce prior information on the sources during the estimation process. In this paper, two new approaches to NTF based source separation are proposed , which do not require any manual component assignment to the sources, but estimate the underlying assignment automatically. Both algorithms use the prior information on the source samples in the estimation process along with either a limit on the minimum number of components each source uses or with a restriction that each component is used by sparse number of sources. The proposed methods are shown to outperform the classic approach with a manual distribution of the components equally among the sources.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study and implement the structural iterative eigensolvers for the large-scale eigenvalue problem in the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) based on the reduced basis approach via low-rank factorizations in generating matrices, introduced in the previous paper. The approach reduces numerical costs down to {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(N{\_}b{\^{}}2){\$} in the size of atomic orbitals basis set, {\$}N{\_}b{\$}, instead of practically intractable {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(N{\_}b{\^{}}6){\$} complexity scaling for the direct diagonalization of the BSE matrix. As an alternative to rank approximation of the static screen interaction part of the BSE matrix, we propose to restrict it to a small active sub-block, with a size balancing the storage for rank-structured representations of other matrix blocks. We demonstrate that the enhanced reduced-block approximation exhibits higher precision within the controlled numerical cost, providing as well a distinct two-sided error estimate for the BSE eigenvalues. It is shown that further reduction of the asymptotic computational cost is possible due to ALS-type iteration in block tensor train (TT) format applied to the quantized-TT (QTT) tensor representation of both long eigenvectors and rank-structured matrix blocks. The QTT-rank of these entities possesses almost the same magnitude as the number of occupied orbitals in the molecular systems, {\$}N{\_}o{\$}, hence the overall asymptotic complexity for solving the BSE problem can be estimated by {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(\backslashlog(N{\_}o) N{\_}o{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}){\$}.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose nonlinear tensor analysis methods: the tensor self-organizing map (TSOM) and the tensor generative topographic mapping (TGTM). TSOM is a straightforward extension of the self-organizing map from high-dimensional data to tensorial data, and TGTM is an extension of the generative topographic map, which provides a theoretical background for TSOM using a probabilistic generative model. These methods are useful tools for analyzing and visualizing tensorial data, especially multimodal relational data. For given n-mode relational data, TSOM and TGTM can simultaneously organize a set of n-topographic maps. Furthermore, they can be used to explore the tensorial data space by interactively visualizing the relationships between modes. We present the TSOM algorithm and a theoretical description from the viewpoint of TGTM. Various TSOM variations and visualization techniques are also described, along with some applications to real relational datasets. Additionally, we attempt to build a comprehensive description of the TSOM family by adapting various data structures.},

abstract = {Tensor clustering is an important tool that exploits intrinsically rich structures in real-world multiarray or Tensor datasets. Often in dealing with those datasets, standard practice is to use subspace clustering that is based on vectorizing multiarray data. However, vectorization of tensorial data does not exploit complete structure information. In this paper, we propose a subspace clustering algorithm without adopting any vectorization process. Our approach is based on a novel heterogeneous Tucker decomposition model taking into account cluster membership information. We propose a new clustering algorithm that alternates between different modes of the proposed heterogeneous tensor model. All but the last mode have closed-form updates. Updating the last mode reduces to optimizing over the multinomial manifold for which we investigate second order Riemannian geometry and propose a trust-region algorithm. Numerical experiments show that our proposed algorithm compete effectively with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms that are based on tensor factorization.},

@article{Anandkumar2012,
abstract = {This work considers a computationally and statistically efficient parameter estimation method for a wide class of latent variable models---including Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models, and latent Dirichlet allocation---which exploits a certain tensor structure in their low-order observable moments (typically, of second- and third-order). Specifically, parameter estimation is reduced to the problem of extracting a certain (orthogonal) decomposition of a symmetric tensor derived from the moments; this decomposition can be viewed as a natural generalization of the singular value decomposition for matrices. Although tensor decompositions are generally intractable to compute, the decomposition of these specially structured tensors can be efficiently obtained by a variety of approaches, including power iterations and maximization approaches (similar to the case of matrices). A detailed analysis of a robust tensor power method is provided, establishing an analogue of Wedin's perturbation theorem for the singular vectors of matrices. This implies a robust and computationally tractable estimation approach for several popular latent variable models.},

Various component analysis methods have played an increasingly important role for the analysis of such coupled data. In this article, we first provide a brief review of existing matrix-based (two-way) component analysis methods for the joint analysis of such data with a focus on biomedical applications. Then, we discuss their important extensions and generalization to multiblock multiway (tensor) data. We show how constrained multiblock tensor decomposition methods are able to extract similar or statistically dependent common features that are shared by all blocks, by incorporating the multiway nature of data. Special emphasis is given to the flexible common and individual feature analysis of multiblock data with the aim to simultaneously extract common and individual latent components with desired properties and types of diversity. Illustrative examples are given to demonstrate their effectiveness for biomedical data analysis.},

@article{Lahat2015,
abstract = {In various disciplines, information about the same phenomenon can be acquired from different types of detectors, at different conditions, in multiple experiments or subjects, among others. We use the term “modality” for each such acquisition framework. Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, it is rare that a single modality provides complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities reporting on the same system introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. As we argue, many of these questions, or “challenges,” are common to multiple domains. This paper deals with two key issues: “why we need data fusion” and “how we perform it.” The first issue is motivated by numerous examples in science and technology, followed by a mathematical framework that showcases some of the benefits that data fusion provides. In order to address the second issue, “diversity” is introduced as a key concept, and a number of data-driven solutions based on matrix and tensor decompositions are discussed, emphasizing how they account for diversity across the data sets. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader, regardless of his or her community of origin, with a taste of the vastness of the field, the prospects, and the opportunities that it holds.},

abstract = {Given a set of images, finding a compact and discriminative representation is still a big challenge especially when multiple latent factors are hidden in the way of data generation. To represent multifactor images, although multilinear models are widely used to parameterize the data, most methods are based on high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), which preserves global statistics but interprets local variations inadequately. To this end, we propose a novel method, called multilinear graph embedding (MGE), as well as its kernelization MKGE to leverage the manifold learning techniques into multilinear models. Our method theoretically links the linear, nonlinear, and multilinear dimensionality reduction. We also show that the supervised MGE encodes informative image priors for image regularization, provided that an image is represented as a high-order tensor. From our experiments on face and gait recognition, the superior performance demonstrates that MGE better represents multifactor images than classic methods, including HOSVD and its variants. In addition, the significant improvement in image (or tensor) completion validates the potential of MGE for image regularization.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm to estimate missing values in tensors of visual data. The values can be missing due to problems in the acquisition process or because the user manually identified unwanted outliers. Our algorithm works even with a small amount of samples and it can propagate structure to fill larger missing regions. Our methodology is built on recent studies about matrix completion using the matrix trace norm. The contribution of our paper is to extend the matrix case to the tensor case by proposing the first definition of the trace norm for tensors and then by building a working algorithm. First, we propose a definition for the tensor trace norm that generalizes the established definition of the matrix trace norm. Second, similarly to matrix completion, the tensor completion is formulated as a convex optimization problem. Unfortunately, the straightforward problem extension is significantly harder to solve than the matrix case because of the dependency among multiple constraints. To tackle this problem, we developed three algorithms: simple low rank tensor completion (SiLRTC), fast low rank tensor completion (FaLRTC), and high accuracy low rank tensor completion (HaLRTC). The SiLRTC algorithm is simple to implement and employs a relaxation technique to separate the dependent relationships and uses the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to achieve a globally optimal solution; the FaLRTC algorithm utilizes a smoothing scheme to transform the original nonsmooth problem into a smooth one and can be used to solve a general tensor trace norm minimization problem; the HaLRTC algorithm applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to our problem. Our experiments show potential applications of our algorithms and the quantitative evaluation indicates that our methods are more accurate and robust than heuristic approaches. The efficiency comparison indicates that FaLTRC and HaLRTC are more efficient than SiLRTC and between FaLRTC an- HaLRTC the former is more efficient to obtain a low accuracy solution and the latter is preferred if a high-accuracy solution is desired.},

@article{Geng2011,
abstract = {Multilinear subspace analysis (MSA) is a promising methodology for pattern-recognition problems due to its ability in decomposing the data formed from the interaction of multiple factors. The MSA requires a large training set, which is well organized in a single tensor, which consists of data samples with all possible combinations of the contributory factors. However, such a "complete" training set is difficult (or impossible) to obtain in many real applications. The missing-value problem is therefore crucial to the practicality of the MSA but has been hardly investigated up to present. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an algorithm named M(2)SA, which is advantageous in real applications due to the following: 1) it inherits the ability of the MSA to decompose the interlaced semantic factors; 2) it does not depend on any assumptions on the data distribution; and 3) it can deal with a high percentage of missing values. M(2)SA is evaluated by face image modeling on two typical multifactorial applications, i.e., face recognition and facial age estimation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of M(2) SA even when the majority of the values in the training tensor are missing.},

abstract = {The problem of incomplete data – i.e., data with missing or unknown values – in multi-way arrays is ubiquitous in biomedical signal processing, network traffic analysis, bibliometrics, social network analysis, chemometrics, computer vision, communication networks, etc. We consider the problem of how to factorize data sets with missing values with the goal of capturing the underlying latent structure of the data and possibly reconstructing missing values (i.e., tensor completion). We focus on one of the most well-known tensor factorizations that captures multi-linear structure, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP). In the presence of missing data, CP can be formulated as a weighted least squares problem that models only the known entries. We develop an algorithm called CP-WOPT (CP Weighted OPTimization) that uses a first-order optimization approach to solve the weighted least squares problem. Based on extensive numerical experiments, our algorithm is shown to successfully factorize tensors with noise and up to 99{\%} missing data. A unique aspect of our approach is that it scales to sparse large-scale data, e.g., 1000×1000×1000 with five million known entries (0.5{\%} dense). We further demonstrate the usefulness of CP-WOPT on two real-world applications: a novel EEG (electroencephalogram) application where missing data is frequently encountered due to disconnections of electrodes and the problem of modeling computer network traffic where data may be absent due to the expense of the data collection process.},

abstract = {We propose a generative model for robust tensor factorization in the presence of both missing data and outliers. The objective is to explicitly infer the underlying low-CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)-rank tensor capturing the global information and a sparse tensor capturing the local information (also considered as outliers), thus providing the robust predictive distribution over missing entries. The low-CP-rank tensor is modeled by multilinear interactions between multiple latent factors on which the column sparsity is enforced by a hierarchical prior, while the sparse tensor is modeled by a hierarchical view of Student-t distribution that associates an individual hyperparameter with each element independently. For model learning, we develop an efficient variational inference under a fully Bayesian treatment, which can effectively prevent the overfitting problem and scales linearly with data size. In contrast to existing related works, our method can perform model selection automatically and implicitly without the need of tuning parameters. More specifically, it can discover the groundtruth of CP rank and automatically adapt the sparsity inducing priors to various types of outliers. In addition, the tradeoff between the low-rank approximation and the sparse representation can be optimized in the sense of maximum model evidence. The extensive experiments and comparisons with many state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the superiorities of our method from several perspectives.},

Using the reduced higher-order SVD the redundancy-free product-basis set is constructed that diminishes dramatically the initial number {\$}O(N{\_}b{\^{}}2){\$} of three-dimensional ({\$}3{\$}D) convolutions, defined over cross products of {\$}N{\_}b{\$} basis functions, to {\$}O(N{\_}b){\$} scaling. The tensor-structured numerical integration with the {\$}3{\$}D Newton convolving kernel is performed in one-dimensional ({\$}1{\$}D) complexity, thus enabling high resolution over fine {\$}3{\$}D Cartesian grids. Furthermore, using the quantized approximation of long vectors ensures the logarithmic storage complexity in the grid size. Finally, we present and analyze two approaches to compute the Cholesky decomposition of the TEI matrix based on two types of precomput...},

abstract = {In this study, we introduce a new framework called Kernel Additive Modelling for audio spectrograms that can be used for multichannel source separation. It assumes that the spectrogram of a source at any time-frequency bin is close to its value in a neighbourhood indicated by a source-specific proximity kernel. The rationale for this model is to easily account for features like periodicity, stability over time or frequency, self-similarity, etc. In many cases, such local dynamics are indeed much more natural to assess than any global model such as a tensor factorization. This framework permits one to use different proximity kernels for different sources and to estimate them blindly using their mixtures only. Estimation is performed using a variant of the kernel backfitting algorithm that allows for multichannel mixtures and permits parallelization. Experimental results on the separation of vocals from musical backgrounds demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Estimating a phenotype distribution conditional on a set of discrete-valued predictors is a commonly encountered task. For example, interest may be in how the density of a quantitative trait varies with single nucleotide polymorphisms and patient characteristics. The subset of important predictors is not usually known in advance. This becomes more challenging with a high-dimensional predictor set when there is the possibility of interaction.

RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel non-parametric Bayes method based on a tensor factorization of predictor-dependent weights for Gaussian kernels. The method uses multistage predictor selection for dimension reduction, providing succinct models for the phenotype distribution. The resulting conditional density morphs flexibly with the selected predictors. In a simulation study and an application to molecular epidemiology data, we demonstrate advantages over commonly used methods.},

abstract = {This paper aims to take general tensors as inputs for supervised learning. A supervised tensor learning (STL) framework is established for convex optimization based learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVM) and minimax probability machines (MPM). Within the STL framework, many conventional learning machines can be generalized to take nth-order tensors as inputs. We also study the applications of tensors to learning machine design and feature extraction by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Our method for tensor based feature extraction is named the tenor rank-one discriminant analysis (TR1DA). These generalized algorithms have several advantages: 1) reduce the curse of dimension problem in machine learning and data mining; 2) avoid the failure to converge; and 3) achieve better separation between the different categories of samples. As an example, we generalize MPM to its STL version, which is named the tensor MPM (TMPM). TMPM learns a series of tensor projections iteratively. It is then evaluated against the original MPM. Our experiments on a binary classification problem show that TMPM significantly outperforms the original MPM.},

abstract = {A three-way array X (or three-dimensional matrix) is an array of numbers xijk subscripted by three indices. A triad is a multiplicative array, xijk = aibjck. Analogous to the rank and the row rank of a matrix, we define rank (X) to be the minimum number of triads whose sum is X, and dim1(X) to be the dimensionality of the space of matrices generated by the 1-slabs of X. (Rank and dim1 may not be equal.) We prove several lower bounds on rank. For example, a special case of Theorem 1 is that rank(X)⩾dim1(UX) + rank(XW) − dim1(UXW), where U and W are matrices; this generalizes a matrix theorem of Frobenius. We define the triple product [A, B, C] of three matrices to be the three-way array whose (i, j, k) element is given by ⩞rairbjrckr; in other words, the triple product is the sum of triads formed from the columns of A, B, and C. We prove several sufficient conditions for the factors of a triple product to be essentially unique. For example (see Theorem 4a), suppose [A, B, C] = [Ā, B̄, C̄], and each of the matrices has R columns. Suppose every set of rank (A) columns of A are independent, and similar conditions hold for B and C. Suppose rank (A) + rank (B) + rank (C) ⩾ 2R + 2. Then there exist diagonal matrices $\Lambda$, M, N and a permutation matrix P such that Ā = AP$\Lambda$, B̄ = BPM, C̄ = CPN. Our results have applications to arithmetic complexity theory and to statistical models used in three-way multidimensional scaling.},

This technique uses a model which is convolutive in both time and frequency, and so can capture instruments which have both time-varying spectra and time-varying fundamental frequencies simultaneously. However, in many cases two or more channels are available, in which case it would be advantageous to have a multi-channel version of the algorithm. To this end, a shifted 2D non-negative tensor factorisation algorithm is derived, which extends non-negative matrix factor 2D deconvolution to the multi-channel case. The use of this algorithm for multi-channel sound source separation of pitched instruments is demonstrated},

abstract = {An unsupervised learning algorithm for the separation of sound sources in one-channel music signals is presented. The algorithm is based on factorizing the magnitude spectrogram of an input signal into a sum of components, each of which has a fixed magnitude spectrum and a time-varying gain. Each sound source, in turn, is modeled as a sum of one or more components. The parameters of the components are estimated by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input spectrogram and the model, while restricting the component spectrograms to be nonnegative and favoring components whose gains are slowly varying and sparse. Temporal continuity is favored by using a cost term which is the sum of squared differences between the gains in adjacent frames, and sparseness is favored by penalizing nonzero gains. The proposed iterative estimation algorithm is initialized with random values, and the gains and the spectra are then alternatively updated using multiplicative update rules until the values converge. Simulation experiments were carried out using generated mixtures of pitched musical instrument samples and drum sounds. The performance of the proposed method was compared with independent subspace analysis and basic nonnegative matrix factorization, which are based on the same linear model. According to these simulations, the proposed method enables a better separation quality than the previous algorithms. Especially, the temporal continuity criterion improved the detection of pitched musical sounds. The sparseness criterion did not produce significant improvements},

Accordingly, just as the spectral decomposition of S is a linear combination of its eigenvalues and the outer product of its corresponding (1st-order tensors) eigenvectors, the spectral decomposition of $\Sigma$ is a linear combination of its eigenvalues and the outer product of its corresponding 2nd-order eigentensors. Analogously, these eigenvalues and 2nd-order eigentensors can be used as features with which to represent and visualize variability in tensor-valued data. Here we suggest a framework to visualize the angular structure of $\Sigma$, and then use it to assess and characterize the variability of synthetic diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) data. The spectral decomposition suggests a hierarchy of symmetries with which to classify the statistical anisotropy inherent in tensor data. We also present maximum likelihood estimates of the sample mean and covariance tensors associated with D, and derive formulae for the expected value of the mean and variance of the projection of D along a particular direction (i.e., the apparent diffusion coefficient or ADC). These findings would be difficult, if not impossible, to glean if we treated 2nd-order tensor random variables as vector-valued random variables, which is conventionally done in multi-variate statistical analysis.},

We show that higher-order tensors (i.e., multiway arrays) enable such a fundamental paradigm shift toward models that are essentially polynomial, the uniqueness of which, unlike the matrix methods, is guaranteed under very mild and natural conditions. Benefiting from the power of multilinear algebra as their mathematical backbone, data analysis techniques using tensor decompositions are shown to have great flexibility in the choice of constraints which match data properties and extract more general latent components in the data than matrix-based methods.},

abstract = {We propose a general technique for obtaining sparse solutions to generalized eigenvalue problems, and call it Regularized Generalized Eigen-Decomposition (RGED). For decades, Fisher׳s discriminant criterion has been applied in supervised feature extraction and discriminant analysis, and it is formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem. Thus RGED can be applied to effectively extract sparse features and calculate sparse discriminant directions for all variants of Fisher discriminant criterion based models. Particularly, RGED can be applied to matrix-based and even tensor-based discriminant techniques, for instance, 2D-Linear Discriminant Analysis (2D-LDA). Furthermore, an iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is developed. The algorithm approximately solves RGED with monotonically decreasing convergence and at an acceptable speed for results of modest accuracy. Numerical experiments based on four data sets of different types of images show that RGED has competitive classification performance with existing multidimensional and sparse techniques of discriminant analysis.},

abstract = {The success of research on matrix completion is evident in a variety of real-world applications. Tensor completion, which is a high-order extension of matrix completion, has also generated a great deal of research interest in recent years. Given a tensor with incomplete entries, existing methods use either factorization or completion schemes to recover the missing parts. However, as the number of missing entries increases, factorization schemes may overfit the model because of incorrectly predefined ranks, while completion schemes may fail to interpret the model factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept: complete the missing entries and simultaneously capture the underlying model structure. To this end, we propose a method called simultaneous tensor decomposition and completion (STDC) that combines a rank minimization technique with Tucker model decomposition. Moreover, as the model structure is implicitly included in the Tucker model, we use factor priors, which are usually known a priori in real-world tensor objects, to characterize the underlying joint-manifold drawn from the model factors. By exploiting this auxiliary information, our method leverages two classic schemes and accurately estimates the model factors and missing entries. We conducted experiments to empirically verify the convergence of our algorithm on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on various kinds of real-world data. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and its potential usage in tensor-based applications. It also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multilinear model analysis and visual data completion tasks.},

abstract = {The problem of direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of seismic plane waves impinging on an array of sensors is considered from a new deterministic perspective using tensor decomposition techniques. In addition to temporal and spatial sampling, further information is taken into account, based on the different propagation speed of body waves (P and S) through solid media. Performances are evaluated through simulated data in terms of the Cram{\'{e}}r–Rao bounds and compared to other reference methods such as ESPRIT and MUSIC, in the presence of additive Gaussian circular noise. The proposed approach is then applied to real seismic data recorded at the Argenti{\'{e}}re glacier, occurring at the interface between the ice mass and the underlying bedrock. MUSIC and ESPRIT rely on the estimation of the covariance matrix of received data, thus requiring a large number of time samples. Moreover, information about propagation speed diversity is not taken into account by existing models in array processing. The discovered advantage in terms of the average error in estimating the direction of arrival of body waves is noteworthy, especially for a low number of sensors, and in separating closely located sources. Additionally, an improvement of precision in processing real seismic data is observed.},

abstract = {In the field of visual data mining, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and its variants have been widely used. The speed and ability to extract image features that are robust against many types of distortions such as scaling, orientation, affine and illumination that HOG offers have made it a popular choice for the task of detecting images in scenes for classification. However, the high dimensionality nature of HOG descriptors (features), usually in the order of multiple thousands of them per image, would require careful consideration in place to achieve accurate and timely categorization of objects within images. This work explores the possibility of processing HOG features as tensors, or multi-dimensional arrays. A direct result of that is tensor decomposition techniques such as canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition performed on the high-order HOG tensors as the mean for dimensionality reduction by filtering. This work focuses on the impact of this approach on both accuracy and efficiency, comparing it against the standard practice of processing HOG features. Validating with the Caltech-101 dataset, the results achieved with artificial neural network (ANN) classification indicate that the proposed method not only improves the overall system performance, it also achieves the edge in accuracy by a notable margin.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of data from multiple sources has the potential to enhance knowledge discovery by capturing underlying structures, which are, otherwise, difficult to extract. Fusing data from multiple sources has already proved useful in many applications in social network analysis, signal processing and bioinformatics. However, data fusion is challenging since data from multiple sources are often (i) heterogeneous (i.e., in the form of higher-order tensors and matrices), (ii) incomplete, and (iii) have both shared and unshared components. In order to address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised data fusion model based on joint factorization of matrices and higher-order tensors.

RESULTS: While the traditional formulation of coupled matrix and tensor factorizations modeling only shared factors fails to capture the underlying structures in the presence of both shared and unshared factors, the proposed data fusion model has the potential to automatically reveal shared and unshared components through modeling constraints. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of identifying shared and unshared components. Furthermore, we measure a set of mixtures with known chemical composition using both LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry) and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and demonstrate that the structure-revealing data fusion model can (i) successfully capture the chemicals in the mixtures and extract the relative concentrations of the chemicals accurately, (ii) provide promising results in terms of identifying shared and unshared chemicals, and (iii) reveal the relevant patterns in LC-MS by coupling with the diffusion NMR data.

CONCLUSIONS: We have proposed a structure-revealing data fusion model that can jointly analyze heterogeneous, incomplete data sets with shared and unshared components and demonstrated its promising performance as well as potential limitations on both simulated and real data.},

These questions are closely related to recommendation systems exploiting context information such as time and location. They require tensor factorization methods scalable with both the dimension and size of a tensor. In this paper, we propose two distributed tensor factorization methods, SALS and CDTF. Both methods are scalable with all aspects of data, and they show an interesting trade-off between convergence speed and memory requirements. SALS updates a subset of the columns of a factor matrix at a time, and CDTF, a special case of SALS, updates one column at a time. On our experiment, only our methods factorize a 5-dimensional tensor with 1B observable entries, 10M mode length, and 1K rank, while all other state-of-the-art methods fail. Moreover, our methods require several orders of magnitude less memory than the competitors. We implement our methods on MapReduce with two widely applicable optimization techniques: local disk caching and greedy row assignment.},

abstract = {Online reviews are valuable sources of information for a variety of decision-making processes such as purchasing products. As the number of online reviews is growing rapidly, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to identify those that are helpful. This has motivated research into the problem of identifying high quality and helpful reviews automatically. The current methods assume that the helpfulness of a review is independent from the readers of that review. However, we argue that the quality of a review may not be the same for different users. For example, a professional and an amateur photographer may rate the helpfulness of a review very differently. In this paper, we introduce the problem of predicting a personalized review quality for recommendation of helpful reviews. To address this problem, we propose a series of increasingly sophisticated probabilistic graphical models, based on Matrix Factorization and Tensor Factorization. We evaluate the proposed models using a database of 1.5 million reviews and more than 13 million quality ratings obtained from Epinions.com. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed latent factor models outperform the state-of-theart approaches using textual and social features. Finally, our experiments confirm that the helpfulness of a review is indeed not the same for all users and that there are some latent factors that affect a user's evaluation of the review quality.

abstract = {Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of a third-order tensor is a minimal de- composition into a sum of rank-1 tensors. We find conditions for the uniqueness of individual rank-1 tensors in CPD and present an algorithm to recover them. We called the algorithm “algebraic” because it relies only on standard linear algebra: we compute Kronecker products, the null space of a matrix, and eigen/singular value decomposition. Our new conditions for uniqueness and the working assumptions for the algorithm are more relaxed than, for instance, the famous Kruskal bound. We address both the case where all tensor dimensions are strictly smaller than the rank and the case where a dimension is at least equal to the rank. In the latter case it is known that if 2 ≤ I ≤ J ≤ K, then the CPD of a generic I×J×K tensor of rank R ≤ K is unique if and only if R ≤ (I−1)(J−1). An existing algebraic algorithm (based on simultaneous diagonalization of a set of matrices) com- putes CPD under the more restrictive constraint R(R − 1) ≤ I(I − 1)J(J − 1)/2 and optimization based algorithms fail to compute the CPD in a reasonable amount of time in the low dimensional case I = 3, J = 7, K = R = 12. By comparison, in our approach it takes less than 1 sec to compute CPD of a generic 3 ×7×12 tensor of rank 12. We show for R ≤ 24 and conjecture for R > 25 that our algorithm can recover the rank-1 tensors in CPD up to R ≤ (I −1)(J −1).},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of searching for videos containing instances of specific human actions. The proposed strategy builds a multimodal latent space representation where both visual content and annotations are simultaneously mapped. The hypothesis behind the method is that such a latent space yields better results when built from multiple data modalities. The semantic embedding is learned using matrix factorization through stochastic gradient descent, which makes it suitable to deal with large-scale collections. The method is evaluated on a large-scale human action video dataset with three modalities corresponding to action labels, action attributes and visual features. The evaluation is based on a query-by-example strategy, where a sample video is used as input to the system. A retrieved video is considered relevant if it contains an instance of the same human action present in the query. Experimental results show that the learned multimodal latent semantic representation produces improved performance when compared with an exclusively visual representation.},

abstract = {This work proposes a histology image indexing strategy based on multimodal representations obtained from the combination of visual features and associated semantic annotations. Both data modalities are complementary information sources for an image retrieval system, since visual features lack explicit semantic information and semantic terms do not usually describe the visual appearance of images. The paper proposes a novel strategy to build a fused image representation using matrix factorization algorithms and data reconstruction principles to generate a set of multimodal features. The methodology can seamlessly recover the multimodal representation of images without semantic annotations, allowing us to index new images using visual features only, and also accepting single example images as queries. Experimental evaluations on three different histology image data sets show that our strategy is a simple, yet effective approach to building multimodal representations for histology image search, and outperforms the response of the popular late fusion approach to combine information.},

@article{Zhang2012,
abstract = {Many machine learning and pattern classification methods have been applied to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables as in classification, several pattern regression methods have also been used to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. However, most existing regression methods focus on estimating multiple clinical variables separately and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information among different clinical variables. On the other hand, in those regression methods, only a single modality of data (usually only the structural MRI) is often used, without considering the complementary information that can be provided by different modalities. In this paper, we propose a general methodology, namely multi-modal multi-task (M3T) learning, to jointly predict multiple variables from multi-modal data. Here, the variables include not only the clinical variables used for regression but also the categorical variable used for classification, with different tasks corresponding to prediction of different variables. Specifically, our method contains two key components, i.e., (1) a multi-task feature selection which selects the common subset of relevant features for multiple variables from each modality, and (2) a multi-modal support vector machine which fuses the above-selected features from all modalities to predict multiple (regression and classification) variables. To validate our method, we perform two sets of experiments on ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data from 45 AD patients, 91 MCI patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC). In the first set of experiments, we estimate two clinical variables such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), as well as one categorical variable (with value of ‘AD’, ‘MCI’ or ‘HC’), from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. In the second set of experiments, we predict the 2-year changes of MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores and also the conversion of MCI to AD from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The results on both sets of experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3T learning scheme can achieve better performance on both regression and classification tasks than the conventional learning methods.},

abstract = {In image categorization the goal is to decide if an image belongs to a certain category or not. A binary classifier can be learned from manually labeled images; while using more labeled examples improves performance, obtaining the image labels is a time consuming process. We are interested in how other sources of information can aid the learning process given a fixed amount of labeled images. In particular, we consider a scenario where keywords are associated with the training images, e.g. as found on photo sharing websites. The goal is to learn a classifier for images alone, but we will use the keywords associated with labeled and unlabeled images to improve the classifier using semi-supervised learning. We first learn a strong Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) classifier using both the image content and keywords, and use it to score unlabeled images. We then learn classifiers on visual features only, either support vector machines (SVM) or least-squares regression (LSR), from the MKL output values on both the labeled and unlabeled images. In our experiments on 20 classes from the PASCAL VOC'07 set and 38 from the MIR Flickr set, we demonstrate the benefit of our semi-supervised approach over only using the labeled images. We also present results for a scenario where we do not use any manual labeling but directly learn classifiers from the image tags. The semi-supervised approach also improves classification accuracy in this case.},

abstract = {Past research in analysis of human affect has focused on recognition of prototypic expressions of six basic emotions based on posed data acquired in laboratory settings. Recently, there has been a shift toward subtle, continuous, and context-specific interpretations of affective displays recorded in naturalistic and real-world settings, and toward multimodal analysis and recognition of human affect. Converging with this shift, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach in the literature that: 1) fuses facial expression, shoulder gesture, and audio cues for dimensional and continuous prediction of emotions in valence and arousal space, 2) compares the performance of two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques applied to the target problem, the bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (BLSTM-NNs), and Support Vector Machines for Regression (SVR), and 3) proposes an output-associative fusion framework that incorporates correlations and covariances between the emotion dimensions. Evaluation of the proposed approach has been done using the spontaneous SAL data from four subjects and subject-dependent leave-one-sequence-out cross validation. The experimental results obtained show that: 1) on average, BLSTM-NNs outperform SVR due to their ability to learn past and future context, 2) the proposed output-associative fusion framework outperforms feature-level and model-level fusion by modeling and learning correlations and patterns between the valence and arousal dimensions, and 3) the proposed system is well able to reproduce the valence and arousal ground truth obtained from human coders. © 2011 IEEE.},

A Health Smart Home is used for this. Our Health Smart Home includes, in a real flat, infrared presence sensors (location), door contacts (to control the use of some facilities), temperature and hygrometry sensor in the bathroom, and microphones (sound classification and speech recognition). A wearable kinematic sensor also informs postural transitions (using pattern recognition) and walk periods (frequency analysis). This data collected from the various sensors are then used to classify each temporal frame into one of the ADL that was previously acquired (seven activities: hygiene, toilet use, eating, resting, sleeping, communication, and dressing/undressing). This is done using support vector machines. We performed a 1-h experimentation with 13 young and healthy subjects to determine the models of the different activities, and then we tested the classification algorithm (cross validation) with real data.},

abstract = {Earth observation through remote sensing images allows the accurate characterization and identification of materials on the surface from space and airborne platforms. Multiple and heterogeneous image sources can be available for the same geographical region: multispectral, hyperspectral, radar, multitemporal, and multiangular images can today be acquired over a given scene. These sources can be combined/fused to improve classification of the materials on the surface. Even if this type of systems is generally accurate, the field is about to face new challenges: the upcoming constellations of satellite sensors will acquire large amounts of images of different spatial, spectral, angular, and temporal resolutions. In this scenario, multimodal image fusion stands out as the appropriate framework to address these problems. In this paper, we provide a taxonomical view of the field and review the current methodologies for multimodal classification of remote sensing images. We also highlight the most recent advances, which exploit synergies with machine learning and signal processing: sparse methods, kernel-based fusion, Markov modeling, and manifold alignment. Then, we illustrate the different approaches in seven challenging remote sensing applications: 1) multiresolution fusion for multispectral image classification; 2) image downscaling as a form of multitemporal image fusion and multidimensional interpolation among sensors of different spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions; 3) multiangular image classification; 4) multisensor image fusion exploiting physically-based feature extractions; 5) multitemporal image classification of land covers in incomplete, inconsistent, and vague image sources; 6) spatiospectral multisensor fusion of optical and radar images for change detection; and 7) cross-sensor adaptation of classifiers. The adoption of these techniques in operational settings will help to monitor our planet from space in the very near future.},

abstract = {An increasingly large amount of multimodal content is posted on social media websites such as YouTube and Facebook everyday. In order to cope with the growth of such so much multimodal data, there is an urgent need to develop an intelligent multi-modal analysis framework that can effectively extract information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal information extraction agent, which infers and aggregates the semantic and affective information associated with user-generated multimodal data in contexts such as e-learning, e-health, automatic video content tagging and human-computer interaction. In particular, the developed intelligent agent adopts an ensemble feature extraction approach by exploiting the joint use of tri-modal (text, audio and video) features to enhance the multimodal information extraction process. In preliminary experiments using the eNTERFACE dataset, our proposed multi-modal system is shown to achieve an accuracy of 87.95{\%}, outperforming the best state-of-the-art system by more than 10{\%}, or in relative terms, a 56{\%} reduction in error rate.},

abstract = {Multimodal data are ubiquitous in engineering, communications, robotics, computer vision, or more generally speaking in industry and the sciences. All disciplines have developed their respective sets of analytic tools to fuse the information that is available in all measured modalities. In this paper, we provide a review of classical as well as recent machine learning methods (specifically factor models) for fusing information from functional neuroimaging techniques such as: LFP, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI. Early and late fusion scenarios are distinguished, and appropriate factor models for the respective scenarios are presented along with example applications from selected multimodal neuroimaging studies. Further emphasis is given to the interpretability of the resulting model parameters, in particular by highlighting how factor models relate to physical models needed for source localization. The methods we discuss allow for the extraction of information from neural data, which ultimately contributes to 1) better neuroscientific understanding; 2) enhance diagnostic performance; and 3) discover neural signals of interest that correlate maximally with a given cognitive paradigm. While we clearly study the multimodal functional neuroimaging challenge, the discussed machine learning techniques have a wide applicability, i.e., in general data fusion, and may thus be informative to the general interested reader.},

abstract = {Automatic emotion recognition systems based on supervised machine learning require reliable annotation of affective behaviours to build useful models. Whereas the dimensional approach is getting more and more popular for rating affective behaviours in continuous time domains, e.g., arousal and valence, methodologies to take into account reaction lags of the human raters are still rare. We therefore investigate the relevance of using machine learning algorithms able to integrate contextual information in the modelling, like long short-term memory recurrent neural networks do, to automatically predict emotion from several (asynchronous) raters in continuous time domains, i.e., arousal and valence. Evaluations are performed on the recently proposed RECOLA multimodal database (27 subjects, 5 min of data and six raters for each), which includes audio, video, and physiological (ECG, EDA) data. In fact, studies uniting audiovisual and physiological information are still very rare. Features are extracted with various window sizes for each modality and performance for the automatic emotion prediction is compared for both different architectures of neural networks and fusion approaches (feature-level/decision-level). The results show that: (i) LSTM network can deal with (asynchronous) dependencies found between continuous ratings of emotion with video data, (ii) the prediction of the emotional valence requires longer analysis window than for arousal and (iii) a decision-level fusion leads to better performance than a feature-level fusion. The best performance (concordance correlation coefficient) for the multimodal emotion prediction is 0.804 for arousal and 0.528 for valence.},

abstract = {Recent studies have proposed various attacks against location privacy using a Markov Chain transition matrix trained for each user. However, when a user has disclosed only a small amount of location information in the past, the training data can be extremely sparse. In this paper, we show how the attacker can solve this sparse data problem, and how the defender can defend against this type of attack. Our proposal is twofold: 1) We propose a training method that regards a set of transition matrices as a “tensor”, and adopt tensor factorization to robustly estimate transition matrices from a small amount of training data. 2) We then focus on a location prediction attack, which predicts a location of a target user from a past location that he/she disclosed, and propose a region merging method to minimize the region size as an optimal defense. The experimental results using the dataset of taxi traces show the effectiveness of our proposals. We also point out that our region merging method is effective especially when the defender has Big Data to train transition matrices.},

abstract = {We present a scalable Bayesian model for low-rank factorization of massive tensors with binary observations. The proposed model has the following key properties: (1) in contrast to the models based on the logistic or probit likelihood, using a zero-truncated Poisson likelihood for binary data allows our model to scale up in the number of $\backslash$emph{\{}ones{\}} in the tensor, which is especially appealing for massive but sparse binary tensors; (2) side-information in form of binary pairwise relationships (e.g., an adjacency network) between objects in any tensor mode can also be leveraged, which can be especially useful in "cold-start" settings; and (3) the model admits simple Bayesian inference via batch, as well as $\backslash$emph{\{}online{\}} MCMC; the latter allows scaling up even for $\backslash$emph{\{}dense{\}} binary data (i.e., when the number of ones in the tensor/network is also massive). In addition, non-negative factor matrices in our model provide easy interpretability, and the tensor rank can be inferred from the data. We evaluate our model on several large-scale real-world binary tensors, achieving excellent computational scalability, and also demonstrate its usefulness in leveraging side-information provided in form of mode-network(s).},

We propose a new model to recover a low-rank tensor by simultaneously performing low-rank matrix factorizations to the all-mode matricizations of the underlying tensor. An alternating minimization algorithm is applied to solve the model, along with two adaptive rank-adjusting strategies when the exact rank is not known. Phase transition plots reveal that our algorithm can recover a variety of synthetic low-rank tensors from significantly fewer samples than the compared methods, which include a matrix completion method applied to tensor recovery and two state-of-the-art tensor completion methods. Further tests on real- world data show similar advantages. Although our model is non-convex, our algorithm performs consistently throughout the tests and gives better results than the compared methods, some of which are based on convex models. In addition, subsequence convergence of our algorithm can be established in the sense that any limit point of the iterates satisfies the KKT condtions.},

abstract = {Tensor decomposition is a powerful computational tool for multiway data analysis. Many popular tensor decomposition approaches-such as the Tucker decomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)-amount to multi-linear factorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between data entities, (ii) various data types (e.g., missing data and binary data), and (iii) noisy observations and outliers. To address these issues, we propose tensor-variate latent nonparametric Bayesian models for multiway data analysis. We name these models InfTucker. These new models essentially conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature space. Unlike classical tensor decomposition models, our new approaches handle both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent Gaussian or t processes with nonlinear covariance functions. Moreover, on network data, our models reduce to nonparametric stochastic blockmodels and can be used to discover latent groups and predict missing interactions. To learn the models efficiently from data, we develop a variational inference technique and explore properties of the Kronecker product for computational efficiency. Compared with a classical variational implementation, this technique reduces both time and space complexities by several orders of magnitude. On real multiway and network data, our new models achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than state-of-art tensor decomposition methods and blockmodels.},

While we can collect vast amounts of data using different analytical methods, data fusion remains a challenging task, in particular, when the goal is to capture the underlying factors and use them for interpretation, e.g., for biomarker identification. Furthermore, many data fusion applications require joint analysis of heterogeneous (i.e., in the form of higher order tensors and matrices) data sets with shared/unshared factors. In order to jointly analyze such heterogeneous data sets, we formulate data fusion as a coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) problem, which has already proved useful in many data mining applications, and discuss its extension to a structure-revealing data fusion model, i.e., a data fusion model that can identify shared and unshared factors. The traditional methods commonly used for data fusion in the presence of shared/unshared factors are matrix factorization-based methods. Using both simulations and prototypical experimental coupled data sets, we assess the performance of various state-of-the-art data fusion methods and demonstrate that while matrix factorization-based approaches have limitations when used for joint analysis of heterogeneous data sets, the structure-revealing CMTF model can successfully capture the underlying factors by exploiting the low-rank structure of higher order data sets.},

abstract = {Fractional anisotropy (FA) analysis of diffusion tensor-images (DTI) has yielded inconsistent abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ). Inconsistencies may arise from averaging heterogeneous groups of patients. Here we investigate whether SZ is a heterogeneous group of disorders distinguished by distinct patterns of FA reductions. We developed a Generalized Factorization Method (GFM) to identify biclusters (i.e., subsets of subjects associated with a subset of particular characteristics, such as low FA in specific regions). GFM appropriately assembles a collection of unsupervised techniques with Non-negative Matrix Factorization to generate biclusters, rather than averaging across all subjects and all their characteristics. DTI tract-based spatial statistics images, which output is the locally maximal FA projected onto the group white matter skeleton, were analyzed in 47 SZ and 36 healthy subjects, identifying 8 biclusters. The mean FA of the voxels of each bicluster was significantly different from those of other SZ subjects or 36 healthy controls. The eight biclusters were organized into four more general patterns of low FA in specific regions: 1) genu of corpus callosum (GCC), 2) fornix (FX)+external capsule (EC), 3) splenium of CC (SCC)+retrolenticular limb (RLIC)+posterior limb (PLIC) of the internal capsule, and 4) anterior limb of the internal capsule. These patterns were significantly associated with particular clinical features: Pattern 1 (GCC) with bizarre behavior, pattern 2 (FX+EC) with prominent delusions, and pattern 3 (SCC+RLIC+PLIC) with negative symptoms including disorganized speech. The uncovered patterns suggest that SZ is a heterogeneous group of disorders that can be distinguished by different patterns of FA reductions associated with distinct clinical features.},

@article{Karahan2015,
abstract = {Current high-throughput data acquisition technologies probe dynamical systems with different imaging modalities, generating massive data sets at different spatial and temporal resolutions-posing challenging problems in multimodal data fusion. A case in point is the attempt to parse out the brain structures and networks that underpin human cognitive processes by analysis of different neuroimaging modalities (functional MRI, EEG, NIRS, etc.). We emphasize that the multimodal, multiscale nature of neuroimaging data is well reflected by a multiway (tensor) structure where the underlying processes can be summarized by a relatively small number of components or “atoms.” We introduce Markov-Penrose diagrams-an integration of Bayesian DAG and tensor network notation in order to analyze these models. These diagrams not only clarify matrix and tensor EEG and fMRI time/frequency analysis and inverse problems, but also help understand multimodal fusion via multiway partial least squares and coupled matrix-tensor factorization. We show here, for the first time, that Granger causal analysis of brain networks is a tensor regression problem, thus allowing the atomic decomposition of brain networks. Analysis of EEG and fMRI recordings shows the potential of the methods and suggests their use in other scientific domains.},

@article{Metzler2015,
abstract = {Tensor factorizations are computationally hard problems, and in particular, are often significantly harder than their matrix counterparts. In case of Boolean tensor factorizations -- where the input tensor and all the factors are required to be binary and we use Boolean algebra -- much of that hardness comes from the possibility of overlapping components. Yet, in many applications we are perfectly happy to partition at least one of the modes. In this paper we investigate what consequences does this partitioning have on the computational complexity of the Boolean tensor factorizations and present a new algorithm for the resulting clustering problem. This algorithm can alternatively be seen as a particularly regularized clustering algorithm that can handle extremely high-dimensional observations. We analyse our algorithms with the goal of maximizing the similarity and argue that this is more meaningful than minimizing the dissimilarity. As a by-product we obtain a PTAS and an efficient 0.828-approximation algorithm for rank-1 binary factorizations. Our algorithm for Boolean tensor clustering achieves high scalability, high similarity, and good generalization to unseen data with both synthetic and real-world data sets.},
