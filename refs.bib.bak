  Abstract                 = {The widespread use of multisensor technology and the emergence of big data sets have highlighted the limitations of standard flat-view matrix models and the necessity to move toward more versatile data analysis tools. We show that higher-order tensors (i.e., multiway arrays) enable such a fundamental paradigm shift toward models that are essentially polynomial, the uniqueness of which, unlike the matrix methods, is guaranteed under very mild and natural conditions. Benefiting from the power of multilinear algebra as their mathematical backbone, data analysis techniques using tensor decompositions are shown to have great flexibility in the choice of constraints which match data properties and extract more general latent components in the data than matrix-based methods.},
